            "background": "    After an extensive career in retail sales management, I became disillusioned with the trend for sales to meet company quotas versus sincerely meeting the needs of the customer. I then altered my career direction to IT support and although I flourished in a tech environment, my previous sales experience resulted in employers’ shoe-horning me into customer-facing positions instead of focusing on my troubleshooting skills. My brief encounters with coding along the way have always been joyful and satisfying, so I’ve decided it is time to take on a career that utilizes skills I have always relished instead of non-intuitive skills I’ve been forced to develop.  Now, with no small sacrifice, I am immersing myself in the accelerated software developer boot camp at Nashville Software School."
