                <p id="week1Blog">
                    When I entered the first week of intense software development training 
                    at Nashville Software School, I fully expected to be thrown into the 
                    proverbial deep end. Hell, I joyfully donned my swimming trunks of Treehouse 
                    pre-work and gracefully dove in. Within the first couple days, in addition to HTML, 
                    CSS, and JavaScript basics, I was introduced to the wonders of utilizing Visual
                    Studio Code, GitBash, Git commands, and GitHub. I must confess the idea of logging coding on a 
                    timeline log of git branches wins from me a hearty HUZZAH!<br><br>
                    Then the current of coding knowledge flowing from Steve and Meg began to pick up and 
                    my swim pace was pushed up a notch. To insure I firmly grasped every new topic, I 
                    committed myself to completing every JavaScript practice exercise at the end of each 
                    chapter. These were excellent! Just when I thought I was a rock star, or Olympic 
                    swimmer if I stay true to my metaphor, Steve introduced us to ticketing in GitHub. 
                    My Excel sheet-organized, flow chart-loving, side of me was doing the happy-dance! But wait... 
                    seven tickets seemed a little much all at once, don't you think?<br><br>
                    By the end of the week, the JavaScript concepts of arrays and objects, which were 
                    familiar to me, had been amped up with the JSON command, allowing me to convert a 
                    database of objects into a string, aka. stringify, which can be stored in a browser's 
                    memory. Fascinating stuff!<br><br>
                    Nearing the end of the last day of my first week at NSS, I completed the exercise on 
                    storing in browser memory. With only a little time remaining in the day, I found myself 
                    submerged by new tickets augmenting my already sizable queue. I have a feeling the 
                    floodgates in the dam holding back the workload will remain open for the next six months.<br><br>
                    Who needs rest and relaxation on the weekend? Bring on the tickets!

                    I'm not sure why we didn't use the modular approach to everything right from the start.
                    Once introduced to this concept, I happily divided the rapidly growing CSS file into 
                    easily understood and even easier managed files. Now, I'm chomping at the bit to do the 
                    same to JavaScript files!
