                <p>
                    When I entered the first week of intense software development training 
                    at Nashville Software School, I fully expected to be thrown into the 
                    proverbial deep end. Hell, I joyfully donned my swiming trunks of Treehouse 
                    pre-work and gracefully dove in. Within the first couple days, in addition to HTML, 
                    CSS, and JavaScript basics, I was introduced to the wonders of utilizing Visual
                    Studio Code, GitBash, Git commands, and GitHub. I must confess the idea of logging coding on a 
                    timeline log of git branches wins from me a hearty HUZZAH!<br><br>
                    Then the current of coding knowledge flowing from Steve and Meg began to pick up and 
                    my swim pace was pushed up a notch. To insure I firmly grasped every new topic, I 
                    committed myself to completing every JavaScript practice execise at the end of each 
                    chapter. These were excellent! Just when I thought I was a rockstar, or Olympic 
                    swimmer if I stay true to my metaphor, Steve introduced us to ticketing in GitHub. 
                    My Excel sheet-organized, flow chart-loving, side of me was doing the happy-dance! But wait... 
                    seven tickets seemed a little much all at once, don't you think?<br><br>
                    By the end of the week, the JavaScript concepts of arrays and objects, which were 
                    familiar to me, had been amped up with the JSON command, allowing me to convert a 
                    database of objects into a string, aka. stringify, which can be stored in a browser's 
                    memory. Fascinating stuff!<br><br>
                    Nearing the end of the last day of my first week at NSS, I completed the exercise on 
                    storing in browser memory. With only a little time remaining in the day, I found myself 
                    submerged by new tickets augmenting my already sizable queue. I have a feeling the 
                    floodgates in the dam holding back the workload will remain open for the next six months.<br><br>
                    Who needs rest and relaxation on the weekend? Bring on the tickets!
