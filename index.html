                    Why I'm here:
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    After an extensive career in sales management, I became disappointed 
                with the trend for sales to meet compoany quotas versus meeting the needs 
                of the customer. I then altered my career direction to IT support and 
                although I flourished in a tech environment, my previous sales experience
                resulted in employers’ shoe-horning me into customer-facing positions 
                instead of focusing on my troubleshooting skills. My brief encounters with 
                coding along the way have always been joyful and satisfying, so I’ve decided 
                it is time to take on a career that utilizes skills I have always relished instead of 
                non-intuitive skills I’ve been forced to develop.  Now, with no small sacrifice, I am 
                immersing myself in the accelerated software developer boot camp at Nashville Software 
                school.
